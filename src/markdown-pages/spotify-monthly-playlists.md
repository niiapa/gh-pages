Every month since the month of April 2017, I have made these little playlists that basically capture what I feel are the best songs I discovered within that time period... 

I've been in a sense 'curating' these for the past 2+ years and they're all made available on both my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/niiapa?si=oESrQQt-QuOSkawLRfFVZw "Nii Apa's Spotify"), and [Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/profile/niiapa "Nii Apa's Apple Music") profiles.

I try to duplicate the playlists as best as possible on both platforms.
Feel free to check them out and let me know what you think :)

P.S... here's this month's playlist:
